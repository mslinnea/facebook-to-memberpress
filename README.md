# Facebook to MemberPress Bridge Plugin for WordPress 
Create a MemberPress transaction when a user registers with Facebook.

Note: This plugin was developed to work with MemberPress Developer Edition version 1.2.6 and
Nextend Facebook Connect version 1.5.7

It creates a MemberPress transaction when a user registers with Facebook.
To adapt this code to your use, you will have to change the product_id.
This plugin is really just for a one-use case, and is probably not very reusable,
but it is a working example of how to extend the functionality of the
Nextend Facebook Connect with the nextend_fb_user_registered hook.
